Core Assignments - 02/02/2021
This folder contains core assignments 2 and 3

Project Folder - 02/02/2021
(I believe it is dependent on local file paths to run at the moment)
Start of Project Assignment, getting used to some node js and javascript features, as well as html. No exact plan for what project I want to do yet. 
- main.js sets up the port for a server and renders an ejs file as html to it
- routes.js sets up the paths on the server and renders an ejs file for each path (just index.ejs and home.ejs for now)
- home.js is mostly just a copy of index.ejs, this file was used to learn adding an additional path to the server
- index.ejs is the main page for the server, it has some html formatting and loads canvas.js, which has a canvas including a 'ball'
with click and drag physics (by this I mean click and drag your mouse, then let go, and it launches the ball, not click and drag the ball around)
